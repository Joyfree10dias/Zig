# Zig
Zig is a general-purpose programming language and toolchain for maintaining robust, optimal, and reusable software.

Robust --> Behavior is correct even for edge cases such as out of memory.<br>
Optimal --> Write programs the best way they can behave and perform.<br>
Reusable --> The same code works in many environments which have different constraints.<br>
Maintainable --> Precisely communicate intent to the compiler and other programmers. The language imposes a low overhead to reading code and is resilient to changing requirements and environments.
